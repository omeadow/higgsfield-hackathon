Growth and Revenue at Higgsfield
Challenge: Generate $10,000 in subscriptions within 6 days through collaborating with relevant
content creators for Higgsfield AI.
01 | Identify 5 Ideal Creator Profiles
For each creator profile:
• Short description (audience type, niche, platform focus)
• 2 to 3 specific creator examples who fit this profile
• Audience scale (micro: 10K-50K, mid-tier: 50K-200K, or macro: 200K+)
• Why they drive subscription revenue (explain alignment with Higgsfield)
02 | Prioritization
Choose the top 3 creator profiles and:
• Explain why this profile is critical for the 6-day timeline
• Assess the conversion risk level (low, medium, or high)
• Describe what happens if we don't partner with creators in this category
03 | Propose Outreach Strategy
For each of the top 3 creator profiles, provide:
Quick Activation (Days 1-2):
• 3 immediate outreach tactics to secure partnerships
Mid-Campaign Boost (Days 3-4):
• 2 engagement strategies to maximize creator content output
Closing Push (Days 5-6):
• 1 urgency-driven campaign element
Resources Required:
• Budget (creator fees, ads), team bandwidth, product access
Success Metrics:
• Track: creator sign-ups, content pieces, conversions, subscription revenue
04 | Creator Partnership Benchmark
Analyze 2 to 3 successful AI tool creator campaigns (e.g., from competitors or adjacent tools):
Evaluate:
• Partnership structure (paid, affiliate, gift)
• Content formats (tutorials, showcases, challenges)
• How creators framed the value proposition
• Call-to-action and conversion tactics
Answer:
• What did they do that drove results?
• What would work for Higgsfield?
• What should we adapt for our timeline?
• What doesn't fit our product or budget?
05 | 6-Day Constraint
Scenario:
• You have a budget of $2,000 for creator fees/promotion
• You have 1 partnership manager available
• Current conversion rate: subscription page visit → paid = 5%
What would you implement across the 6 days?
Create a day-by-day action plan.
